### Testing (Build from Source)

The testing suite for this package makes use of a ros1 bag, and depends on the following [repo](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2_bag_v2). In order to get it to work
you need to source both the ros1 underlay and the ros2 underlay in your ~/.bashrc file. Do this in a new terminal. 

```
# ROS1 
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

# ROS2
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source /usr/share/colcon_cd/function/colcon_cd.sh 
export _colcon_cd_root=/opt/ros/foxy

```

### Deprecation Warning

As far as we can tell the vendor package for Alvar is no longer being actively being maintained. 
The underlying OpenCV Implementation has been upgraded, but it is unclear how worthwhile it is to keep maintaining this package. 
Users should consider using the tag tracking [libraries](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html) natively supported by OpenCV as they handle a greater variety of tags, and provide similar functionality.  

# Miscellaneous 

Building this package requires building [perception_pcl](https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/tree/foxy-devel) from source. 

In your workspace perform the following: 

```
git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/ -b foxy-devel
```
